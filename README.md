## App Analysis
### NestedScrollView widget
References:
- https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/NestedScrollView-class.html

NestedScrollView is a scrolling view that inside of which can be nested other scrolling views, with their scroll positions being intrinsically linked.

Use case 1: a scrollable view with a a flexible SliverAppBar containing a TabBar in the header (built by headerSliverBuilder), and with a TabBarView in the body, such that the scrolable view's contents vary based on which tab is visible.

### SliverAppBar widget

SliverAppBar widget is a extendable and contractable app bar. It is opposite of AppBar widget - a fixed-height app bar that is used by Scafford.appBar.

Use case 1: SliverAppBar is typically used as the first child of CustomScrollView, which lets the app bar integrate with the scroll view so that it can vary in height according to the scroll ofset or float above the other content in the scroll view

### Tab

To display tabs in Flutter, use the combination of DefaultTabController, TabBar, and TabBarView widgets.

Example 1:
return MaterialApp(
    home: DefaultTabController(
        length: 3,
        child: Scafford(
            appBar: AppBar(
                bottom: TabBar(
                    tabs: [
                        Tab(text: "Cat"),
                        Tab(text: "Dog"),
                        Tab(text: "Rabbit"),
                    ]
                ),
            ),//appBar
            body: TabBarView(
                children: [
                    Image(image: AssetImage('assets/cat.jpg')),
                    Image(image: AssetImage('assets/dog.jpg')),
                    Image(image: AssetImage('assets/rabbit.jpg'))
                ],
            ),//body

        )
    )
)
